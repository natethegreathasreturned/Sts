<h1><u>St.Denis Introduction</u></h1>
        <p style="color: green">St.Denis is one of the fourteen Holy Helpers.
             He is a martyr and what he did after is pretty interesting.</p></u>
             <br>
             <u><h1>How St.Denis got martyred</h1></u>
             <p>St.Denis got martyred by getting beheaded, which in my opinion is the worst way to die</p>
             <u><h1>What did St.Denis do when he got beheaded?</h1></u>
             <p>St.Denis kept on walking for miles while preaching a sermon of repentance while being accompanied
                by Angels who made him braver than ever.
             </p>
             <u><h1>Prayer to St.Denis</h1></u>
             <p>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

                O God, Who conferred Your saving Faith on the people of France through Your holy bishop and martyr Denis, and did glorify him before and after his martyrdom
                 by many miracles. Grant us, through his intercession, that the Faith practiced and preached
                  by him may be our light on the way of life, so that we may be preserved from all
                   anxieties of conscience, and if by human frailty we have sinned, we may return to
                    You speedily by true penance.  Moreover, I beseech You to graciously grant me, through
                     the merits and intercession of this powerful Helper, the petition which through them
                      I humbly place before You, devoutly saying, “Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.”
                
                Amen </p>
